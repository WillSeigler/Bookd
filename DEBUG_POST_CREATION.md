1# Debug Post Creation Issues

## Current Status
✅ Removed visibility options - all posts are public
✅ Removed post types - all posts are general
✅ Fixed Cloudinary configuration error message
✅ Improved error handling in create post modal

## Next Steps to Debug Post Creation

### 1. Check Browser Console
When you try to create a post, open browser dev tools (F12) and check the Console tab for detailed error messages.

### 2. Check Network Tab
In browser dev tools, go to Network tab and watch for failed requests when creating a post.

### 3. Test Simple Post Creation
Try creating a post with just text (no media) to see if the basic functionality works:
1. Open create post modal
2. Add only text content: "Test post"
3. Click submit
4. Check console for errors

### 4. Test Database Connection
Verify your database connection by trying other features that work (like viewing your profile).

### 5. Check Supabase Logs
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on "Logs" in the sidebar
3. Watch for errors when you try to create a post

## Common Issues to Check

### Database Issues:
- ❓ Are all database migrations applied?
- ❓ Is the posts table created with correct schema?
- ❓ Are RLS (Row Level Security) policies allowing post creation?

### Authentication Issues:
- ❓ Are you properly signed in?
- ❓ Is the user ID being passed correctly?

### Environment Issues:
- ❓ Are Supabase environment variables set correctly?
- ❓ Is the development server running on the correct port?

## Quick Test Script

Try running this in your browser console on the home page:

```javascript
// Test if user is authenticated
console.log('Current user:', window.location.href);

// Test post creation service
import { createPostsService } from './src/services/client/posts.js';
const service = createPostsService();
service.createPost({
  content: 'Test post from console',
  post_type: 'general',
  visibility: 'public'
}).then(result => {
  console.log('Post creation result:', result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Post creation error:', error);
});
```

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- No console errors
- Network request returns 200/201 status
- Post appears in feed immediately
- Database shows new post entry

### Failure Indicators:
- Console shows specific error messages
- Network request fails (400, 401, 403, 500 status)
- Alert shows "Failed to create post"
- No new entry in database

## Next Steps
After you try creating a post and check the console/network tabs, let me know:
1. What error messages you see in the console
2. What the network request shows (status code, response)
3. Whether basic features like viewing profile still work

This will help pinpoint exactly what's causing the issue!
